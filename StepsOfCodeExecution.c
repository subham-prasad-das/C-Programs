=>Execution of codes in C programming Language ==>

The process of executing a program involves several steps, including compilation, linking, loading, and execution. Here's an overview of each step:

1. **Writing Source Code**:
   - The programmer writes the source code of the program using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

2. **Compilation**:
   - The source code files are passed to the compiler, which translates the human-readable source code into machine-readable object code.
   - The compiler performs lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation.
   - The output of the compilation process is one or more object files containing machine code, but not yet executable.

3. **Linking**:
   - If the program consists of multiple source files or relies on external libraries, the linker combines these object files together to produce a single executable file.
   - The linker resolves symbolic references between different object files and libraries.
   - It also performs tasks like resolving external function calls, resolving references to global variables, and organizing memory addresses.
   - The output of the linking process is an executable file.

4. **Loading**:
   - The operating system loads the executable file into memory when the program is executed.
   - The loader allocates memory space for the program's code and data segments.
   - It also performs address binding, resolving any addresses referenced in the program to actual memory locations.
   - After loading, the program is ready to be executed.

5. **Execution**:
   - The CPU begins executing the instructions in the program's code segment.
   - The program interacts with the operating system, other programs, and external devices as necessary.
   - During execution, the program may generate output, process input, perform calculations, and modify data.
   - Eventually, the program terminates, either normally by reaching the end of the main function or abnormally due to an error or external signal.

6. **Bytecode (Optional)**:
   - In some programming languages like Java and Python, an additional step may be present where the source code is compiled into bytecode instead of machine code.
   - Bytecode is an intermediate representation of the program that can be executed by a virtual machine.
   - The bytecode is then interpreted or compiled Just-In-Time (JIT) into native machine code by the runtime environment during execution.

Each of these steps plays a crucial role in the process of converting source code into a running program. The compiler, linker, loader, and operating system work together to translate, organize, and execute the program's instructions efficiently.
